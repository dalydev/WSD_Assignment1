#WSD Assignment 1
#Develop a Node.js-based API for data persistence.
#This API is initially to get into the Patient Transfer system being devloped for my final year Project.
#Adminstrative acces to the patient transfer system will allow for CRUD activity for hospitals to have access to the system.
#This will later be developed to allow similar access to departments within each hospital, as well as the regions within which the hopitals are bases.
#Doctors and users to the system will also be added to the API at a later stage.

#At this point, I have GET and POST working, using a stubAPI in hospitals.js
#Prior to using the stubAPI, PUT and DELETE were also working.
#The coding will be corrected and completed for Assignment2, whereby, it is likely that this API will link into my patientTransfer DB on mlab for direct access to manipulating the data held there.
